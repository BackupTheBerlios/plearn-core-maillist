Le 08-04-07 &#224; 20:20, Nicolas Chapados a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hello PLearn gurus,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (That should include Olivier, Pascal and Hugo, if not many  
</I>&gt;<i> others!).  I have an intriguing question about VarArrays which has  
</I>&gt;<i> just lost me, oh, a few wasted hours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Func.cc, we have the following piece of code for computing the  
</I>&gt;<i> fprop-path:
</I>&gt;<i> void Function::build_() { // ... fproppath = propagationPath 
</I>&gt;<i> (inputs, outputs); if (fproppath.length()==0) // to handle the  
</I>&gt;<i> weird case in which there is no path from inputs to outputs // but  
</I>&gt;<i> outputs still depends on parameters and we want to represent that  
</I>&gt;<i> dependency { fproppath = propagationPath(inputs &amp; parameters,  
</I>&gt;<i> outputs); bproppath = propagationPath(inputs &amp; parameters,  
</I>&gt;<i> outputs); } else bproppath = propagationPath(inputs,  
</I>&gt;<i> outputs); // ... } My question is as follows: WHY is it that the  
</I>&gt;<i> propagation path is first found from inputs to outputs only,  
</I>&gt;<i> without regard for the parameters, and ONLY if such a path does not  
</I>&gt;<i> exist does it try to include parameters as well?
</I>
I believe that a Func was meant to compute the output from the input  
only, not to recompute intermediate transformation of parameters when  
the parameters they depend on do change.
There are probably 2 reasons:
a) efficiency reason. Ex. when computing a function and gradient on a  
batch (as a SumOf can do), you certainly do not want to unnecessarily  
recompute possibly very costly transformations of your parameters for  
each example you see.
b) correct computation of gradients when using SumOf or similar  
operations, and in particular when doing a SumOf inside a SumOf or  
similar (ProductOf?). In this case, you want to accumulate gradients  
to the immediate parents (transformed parameters) while doing the  
SumOf and only *then* backpropagate *once* the resulting total  
gradient to the parents of these  parents (the untransformed  
parameters).

The special case was probably added as a necessary hack for a special  
situation (possibly also to do with SumOf or the like).

This explanation is certainly as foggy as that stuff is in my old  
memory, but this is all I can offer in terms of &quot;explanation&quot;.
I however fear that If you change this as you are suggesting, things  
are likely to go horribly wrong elsewhere (as might or might not be  
caught by testsuite). A particularly tricky test case would be SumOf  
within SumOf or similar that I remember you using somewhere...
I would also suggest a less dangerous fix: add an option and  
constructor parameter such as always_propagate_parameters which would  
be false by default, but you can set to true if this is the behaviour  
you want here.

&gt;<i> In other words, why does the code not look like this instead (which  
</I>&gt;<i> I would think to be preferable in ALL circumstances, but that's why  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm asking) ::
</I>&gt;<i> void Function::build_() { // ... fproppath = propagationPath(inputs  
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; parameters, outputs); bproppath = propagationPath(inputs &amp;  
</I>&gt;<i> parameters, outputs); // ... } The original formulation causes very  
</I>&gt;<i> hard-to-track-down problems.  I have a code snippet of the  
</I>&gt;<i> following form:
</I>&gt;<i> Var output1 = product(processed_input, m_woutput1); Var output2 =  
</I>&gt;<i> product(processed_input, -m_woutput1); where &quot;processed_input&quot; is  
</I>&gt;<i> some Var resulting from a prior processing (the hidden layer of a  
</I>&gt;<i> neural network), and m_woutput1 is a SourceVariable representing a  
</I>&gt;<i> model parameter.
</I>
I suppose you are declaring a Func with inputs = processed_input and  
outputs = output2 (you didn't specify in your message what function  
you are declaring, but I guess this is it).

&gt;<i> What happens is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> All the computations for output1 proceed correctly, because the  
</I>&gt;<i> path-marking code in BinaryVariable wants to first mark  
</I>&gt;<i> processed_input (which succeeds), then mark m_woutput1 (which  
</I>&gt;<i> fails, since it's a parameter, thence a SourceVariable, but it NOT  
</I>&gt;<i> pre-marked at the start of proppath construction within  
</I>&gt;<i> VarArray::propagationPath). BUT the whole product succeeds in being  
</I>&gt;<i> marked since either branch must succeed.
</I>&gt;<i> The computation for output2 produces the following major bug: the  
</I>&gt;<i> NegateElementsVariable (corresponding to the unary minus) is never  
</I>&gt;<i> made part of the proppath, since first it's trying to mark  
</I>&gt;<i> m_woutput1 (which fails, for the reason given above), yet the whole  
</I>&gt;<i> product succeeds since processed_input succeeds.
</I>&gt;<i> So what happens is that output1 is computed correctly, whereas  
</I>&gt;<i> output2 always gives a value of zero, since the &quot;value&quot; of the  
</I>&gt;<i> NegateElementsVariable is never updated, it not being part of the  
</I>&gt;<i> proppath.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would gladly like to hear the rationale for the form of the  
</I>&gt;<i> current code.  If nobody can answer me within 24 hours, I will  
</I>&gt;<i> commit the suggested fix (which, incidentally, corrects my problem).
</I>
Hope the above helps.
