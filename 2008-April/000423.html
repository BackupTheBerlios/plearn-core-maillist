<PRE>Hello PLearn gurus,

(That should include Olivier, Pascal and Hugo, if not many others!).  I 
have an intriguing question about VarArrays which has just lost me, oh, 
a few wasted hours.

In Func.cc, we have the following piece of code for computing the 
fprop-path:

void Function::build_()
{
    // ...
    fproppath = propagationPath(inputs, outputs);
    if (fproppath.length()==0) // to handle the weird case in which there is no path from inputs to outputs
        // but outputs still depends on parameters and we want to represent that dependency 
    {
        fproppath = propagationPath(inputs &amp; parameters, outputs);
        bproppath = propagationPath(inputs &amp; parameters, outputs);
    }
    else
        bproppath = propagationPath(inputs, outputs);
    // ...
}

My question is as follows: WHY is it that the propagation path is first 
found from inputs to outputs only, without regard for the parameters, 
and ONLY if such a path does not exist does it try to include parameters 
as well?  In other words, why does the code not look like this instead 
(which I would think to be preferable in ALL circumstances, but that's 
why I'm asking) ::

void Function::build_()
{
    // ...
    fproppath = propagationPath(inputs &amp; parameters, outputs);
    bproppath = propagationPath(inputs &amp; parameters, outputs);
    // ...
}

The original formulation causes very hard-to-track-down problems.  I 
have a code snippet of the following form:

    Var output1 =  product(processed_input,   m_woutput1);
    Var output2 =  product(processed_input,  -m_woutput1);

where &quot;processed_input&quot; is some Var resulting from a prior processing 
(the hidden layer of a neural network), and m_woutput1 is a 
SourceVariable representing a model parameter. What happens is as follows:

    * All the computations for output1 proceed correctly, because the
      path-marking code in BinaryVariable wants to first mark
      processed_input (which succeeds), then mark m_woutput1 (which
      fails, since it's a parameter, thence a SourceVariable, but it NOT
      pre-marked at the start of proppath construction within
      VarArray::propagationPath). BUT the whole product succeeds in
      being marked since either branch must succeed.
    * The computation for output2 produces the following major bug: *the
      NegateElementsVariable (corresponding to the unary minus) is never
      made part of the proppath*, since first it's trying to mark
      m_woutput1 (which fails, for the reason given above), yet the
      whole product succeeds since processed_input succeeds.

So what happens is that output1 is computed correctly, whereas output2 
always gives a value of zero, since the &quot;value&quot; of the 
NegateElementsVariable is never updated, it not being part of the proppath.

So I would gladly like to hear the rationale for the form of the current 
code.  If nobody can answer me within 24 hours, I will commit the 
suggested fix (which, incidentally, corrects my problem).

    Thanks to all!
    + Nicolas
