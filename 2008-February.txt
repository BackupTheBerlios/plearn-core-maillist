Subject: [Plearn-core] Change in NNet data representation
Message-ID: <20080225165720.GA28146@opale.iro.umontreal.ca>

Just to let everyone know I made some changes in NNet to store the data
(e.g. input, hidden layer and output layer variables) as row vectors
rather than column vectors (so that I can more easily use matrices of
multiple row input vectors).
Everything should still be working as expected, but if you run into any
trouble (most likely size mismatchs in Variable / Matrix operations),
please let me know. NNet should be fine, but maybe sub-classes not
tested in PLearn could exhibit some issues.

Quick fix if anything really bad happens: update NNet.cc back to r8568.
