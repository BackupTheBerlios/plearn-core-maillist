</I>Well, I at least believe it could be useful to take the time to think 
about it. I also believe a good dataset abstraction is a prerequisite 
before attempting designing class interfaces that are to process 
datates. Also this comes form seeing how the VMatrix abstraction has 
been extended beyond its limits.
&gt;&gt;<i> This, I believe, is a prerequisite before attempting any serious generic 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> learner redesign.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I have been proposing is a strategy for refactoring the code such
</I>&gt;<i> that the learners, splitting algorithms, testing methods, and data
</I>&gt;<i> sources can be implemented as independently as possible, and we can
</I>&gt;<i> build the class hierarchy *last*, without needing to recode any of the
</I>&gt;<i> implementations.  If our first hierarchy doesn't work for a particular
</I>&gt;<i> new problem, we can just as easily make another one that is more
</I>&gt;<i> suitable.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Independent implementations will always use some specific (and 
potentially large) language/framework/runtime (ex: matlab). So I really 
see what you propose as a way  to define another basic framework (made 
of dlls) which would *hopefully* make it easier to build 2-way bridges 
between other frameworks or codes. A good reality check would then be 
whether this would make it easy to use a learner written in matlab 
inside a boosting algorithm written in Java with a data source object 
from Torch, using a python Splitter inside a PLearn HyperLearner???? In 
any case you or somebody will have to build the bridges for each of the 
target frameworks to export a dll interface according to your 
specifications. Without this, the dll interface will be either a mostly 
empty shell, or the start of yet another new independant framework from 
scratch. Building these bridges is a huge undertaking in itself, and 
you'll find out that each framework will have slightly different 
abstractions that will not exactly match yours or easily fit with the 
way you intended to use them. The Devil *really* is in the details, but 
unfortunately you might not know how much this is true until you broke a 
few teeth over it on your own...

Anyway, I don't want to carry on this discussion over email, as it is 
eating up too much of my time (I'm a terribly slow email writer). I feel 
I already did share what I could as constructive (or destructive? OK, 
let's say re-structive) comments. But if you still want to write your 
own framework the way you envision it, go ahead, it certainly is a very 
instructive (although time-consuming) undertaking, and it's natural to 
want to attempt doing it better than what exists.
