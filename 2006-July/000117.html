Yes, since that is what seems to be needed for pymake, pytest and

OK, I didn't think about that. What would that system be used for?
Launching several plearn servers and communicating with them from a
central task manager?

Would unix pipes be enough for the communication of these processes ?

I'm not sure you can do that on the mammouth (I really have to check the
documentation), or with condor (I don't know if it is possible to
specify that a group of jobs must be running at the same time on
different machines).

&gt;<i> These is really a different focus, and maybe we should indeed consider

</I>
Since I'm not sure I see what you really expect from that system, I
don't know how we can combine both.

I would be in favor of putting the two functionalities into two
different systems, but we might take advantage of reusing some
components.
