It seems that we have a different focus here. You seam really focused on 
a batch job queue of independent jobs, while my focus is more on 
launching parallel processing jobs which may need to communicate: so 
they have to run together, not one after the other... Hence it's 
important to know how many I may expect to launch together at the same 
time (the &quot;query&quot; operation),  and to get some initial i/o communication 
channel to them.

These is really a different focus, and maybe we should indeed consider 2 
different sub-systems, but both should be adressed somehow.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think &quot;no more resources available&quot; should not produce an error, but

</I>&gt;<i>   - distrlaunch did not manage to launch the jobs (queue full, the
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;cluster&quot; command failed, ...)
</I>&gt;<i>   - the job was launched and failed
</I>&gt;<i> In the last case, we should not produce an error, it would be the job of
</I>&gt;<i> the program (or programmer) who wanted to execute these jobs to check
</I>&gt;<i> their output and return value in the logs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * Most importantly, it should be possible for the process calling the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access i/o streams of the launched command (i.e. its 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stdin/stdout/stderr) for communication purpose. This should at least be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible when launching a single command (the i/o of the remotely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> launched command should be redirected to the caller).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I totally agree that it should be possible to easily redirect i/o

</I>&gt;<i> I don't even know if bqtools allows to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * I suggest using a single python command (ex: distrlaunch) with

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that specifying a batch of commands to run on the command line

</I>&gt;<i> The execution of jobs from the command-line should go through another
