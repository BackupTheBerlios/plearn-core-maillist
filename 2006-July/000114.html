It might be useful, but in my opinion, the calling program shouldn't
worry about that, since the queuing of jobs is done by the cluster
managing system (or the &quot;dispatching-by-ssh module&quot;).

For instance, on the mammouth, we don't have a way to know on which
sub-cluster the next batch of jobs we submit will be launched, so we
don't really know the number of &quot;available&quot; computation units... but we
don't care, because even if we submit a large batch, the remaining jobs
will be queued and executed when machines are free.

If we add the support for another &quot;cluster&quot; system that has no support
for queuing, then we should implement it inside the module.

&gt;<i>   * When requesting to launch a command, and it fails, it should be

</I>
I think &quot;no more resources available&quot; should not produce an error, but
&quot;queue full&quot; should. That being said, we should make a difference
between the following cases:
  - the command line is ill-formed (syntax error in calling distrlaunch)
  - distrlaunch did not manage to launch the jobs (queue full, the
    &quot;cluster&quot; command failed, ...)
  - the job was launched and failed
In the last case, we should not produce an error, it would be the job of
the program (or programmer) who wanted to execute these jobs to check
their output and return value in the logs.

&gt;<i>   * Most importantly, it should be possible for the process calling the

</I>
I totally agree that it should be possible to easily redirect i/o
from/to files, but I'm a bit skeptical about redirecting to a tty.
I don't even know if bqtools allows to do that.

&gt;<i>   * I suggest using a single python command (ex: distrlaunch) with 
</I>&gt;<i> several possible subcommands or options and online help.
</I>
I think that specifying a batch of commands to run on the command line
is not really easy... I would rather export a python function, one
argument of which would be a list of strings: the commands to execute.

The execution of jobs from the command-line should go through another
script, such as apdispatch.
